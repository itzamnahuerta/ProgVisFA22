The JMPR is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). JMPR, which consists of the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment and the WHO Core Assessment Group, is a long standing process under the United Nations. During the Meetings, the FAO and WHO Panel of Experts is responsible for reviewing the toxicology, metabolism, environmental fate, use patterns, residue and analytical aspects of the pesticides under consideration to determine if pesticide residue values will be at a safe dietary intake level for the various populations of the world. The JMPR dietary risk assessments are used to determine the proposed maximum residue limits (i.e., levels of pesticide residue that may be tolerated on food commodities in international trade). Thus, JMPR serves as a scientific advisory body to the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Advice to the Codex Alimentarius Commission on pesticides is provided through the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR). The JMPR provides for an exchange of information with colleagues from around the world.
